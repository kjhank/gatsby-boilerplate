# Gatsby boilerplate with Styled Components and linters

Gatsby + styled-components boilerplate with stylelint and eslint configs. Mainly for my personal projects.

## Includes:

* `GlobalStyle` component with a customized CSS reset,
* a global `Layout` component wrapper,
* `polished` for SASS-like functions in Styled Components,
* `gatsby-plugin-alias-imports` for import aliases like `@components`, `@pages` etc. (also in jsconfig.json),
* polyfill for smooth JS scroll,
* some basic breakpoints for RWD


## Quick-start 🏎:

1. ### Clone the repo 👯:

	```sh
	git clone git@github.com:kjhank/gatsby-styled-components.git

2. ### Install everything
